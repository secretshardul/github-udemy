Stash temporarily stashes away changes in working directory
so you can work on something else and apply them later.
Stashing works on both working directory and staging area.
$ git stash
$ git stash list    -lists stash
    stash@{0}: WIP on master: c7c1abf added stashed updates
    stash@{1}: WIP on master: c7c1abf added stashed updates 
$ git stash apply   -apply changes
$ git stash drop    -only removes 0th 
$ git stash clear   -remove all elements
$ git stash pop     -combines apply and drop in 1 step


Stashed changes don't appear in $ git status

65. Stashing untracked files
Files not tracked by git are not stashed.
git stash -u    -stash untracked file

66. multiple stashes-
stash is stored in stack format where latest element is at 
0th index.
$ git stash show stash@{1}      -show specific element
$ git stash drop stash@{1}      -drop specific

67. stashing on new branch
$ git stash branch newchanges
it creates new branch and pops stash on it.
