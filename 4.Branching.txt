52. Branching
Making all changes on master branch is not good practice. We should 
make feature branches to isolate changes and then integrate them in 
master after they're stabilized.
$ git branch mynewbranch		-create "mynewbranch"
$ git branch -a		-show all branches and active branch
$git checkout mynewbranch	-shifts branch

Initially all branch labels point to same commit. A new branch won't 
actually be starting a branch until commits are added.

$ git branch -m mynewbranch newbranch	-rename as newbranch
Deleting branch- Current branch can't be deleted. You must switch to 
different branch for deleting.
$ git branch -d newbranch

53. Shortcut for branch creation and checkout
git checkout -b title-change

Merging: to merge title-change branch with master, come back 
to master branch.
$ git checkout master
$git merge title-change
This is a *fast forward* merge because master branch had no commits 
distinct from title-change branch. The title-change commits directly get
placed on master as if we had never branched.
$ git branch -d title-change        -Deleting branch after merge

54. Disable fast forward merges
$ git merge add-copyright --no-ff
This shows the branch structure in "$ git hist"(alias)
*   54da029 (HEAD -> master) Merge branch 'add-copyright'
|\
| * e3de45e (add-copyright) copyright in README
| * be17e4a copyright in HTML
|/
* 10842fe Revert "adding copyright notice in html and READM"

55. Automatic merges: no special command. They happen when branches have
separate commits.
$ git merge simple-changes -m "merging changes from simple-
changes branch"
*   22f197b (HEAD -> master) merging changes from simple-changes branch
|\
| * d3feb71 (simple-changes) added team member to humans.txt* | 73a1a6d added how to contribute in README

56. merge conflicts
Conflicts happen when different branches try modifying same text.
(master)$ git merge realwork 
this gives error.
mergetool is used to resolve conflict. It generates .orig file containing
original changes. This can be put to .gitignore.
$ git mergetool
Commit the changes
